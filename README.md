Torrent-based media library manager

torrman is a torrent management package specific to media libraries. It is currently a work in-progress. torrman is intended to be used in conjunction with Transmission or other bittorrent clients that support script-calling on download completion. The goal is to create a logical taxonomy for personal movie/TV/media libraries, capable of being parsed by frontend media streamers (such as Boxee or XBMC), all without sacrificing torrent seeding requirements.

Current plans are to keep management a manual, hands-on approach to ensure that media nomenclature is 100% accurate. Naming and linking automation might be possible, but will only be included at later stages via suggested data.
